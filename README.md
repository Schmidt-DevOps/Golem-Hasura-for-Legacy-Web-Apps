# Golem-Hasura-for-Legacy-Web-Apps

This is a demonstration of one of the ways of modernizing a legacy web application.

The demo web application is the [Dell DVD Store](https://linux.dell.com/dvdstore/) that was once an example
of [pgFoundry](https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/projects/pgFoundry/dbsamples/dellstore2/dellstore2-normal-1.0/). It's GPL-2-licensed and so is this repo.
